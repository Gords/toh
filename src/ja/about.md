## Project Overview

This project explores the complexity of Nikkei identity through Ñanduti, a traditional Paraguayan lace, and how this cultural material can reflect and transform the identity of the Nikkei community in Paraguay.

## Ñanduti: A Cultural Bridge

Ñanduti is a lace with Spanish origins, derived from a lace called Tenerife, from the Canary Islands. The indigenous people of Paraguay who learned it from the Spanish incorporated motifs inspired by Paraguayan scenes, nature, traditions, and daily life, and called it Ñanduti, which means "spider web" in Guarani, the second official language of Paraguay, giving it its own identity.

## The Nikkei Experience

Like Ñanduti, the collective identity of Japanese immigrants and their descendants is interwoven with threads of diverse traditions, forming a pattern that honors both their roots and the experiences acquired in new lands.
