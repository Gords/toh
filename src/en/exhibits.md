## Ongoing Exhibition
### Threads of Hybridity: 日系とニャンドゥティの物語

<img src="/images/background/flyer.png" alt="Threads of Hybridity" class="flyer" loading="lazy">

This exhibition explores the links between Paraguayan Ñanduti lace and the cultural identity of the Nikkei community. It traces the origins of this craft, which was introduced to Paraguay from Spain during the colonial period, and traces Ñanduti's journey to Japan through Paraguayan and Japanese Nikkei culture.

The exhibition first compares traditional pieces made by Paraguayan artisans with those by members of the Ñanduti Association in Japan. The exhibition will also feature a capsule collection of contemporary interpretations of Ñanduti, created by Paraguayan fashion graduate student Emi Fukuoka in collaboration with members of the Japanese Ñanduti Association.
