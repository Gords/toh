## Project Overview

This project explores the complexity of Nikkei identity through Ñanduti, a traditional Paraguayan lace, examining how this cultural material reflects and transforms the identity of the Nikkei community in Paraguay.

## Ñanduti

Ñanduti is a lace of Spanish origin, derived from a technique called Tenerife. When introduced to Paraguay during the colonial period, the indigenous people adapted it, incorporating motifs inspired by Paraguayan nature, traditions, and daily life. They named it Ñanduti, meaning "spider web" in Guarani, Paraguay's second official language, giving the lace a distinctly Paraguayan identity.

## The Nikkei Experience

Like Ñanduti, the collective identity of Japanese immigrants and their descendants is interlaced with threads of diverse traditions, forming a pattern that honors both their cultural roots and the experiences acquired in new lands.
